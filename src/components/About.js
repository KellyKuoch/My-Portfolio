      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Kelly Kuoch, a Computer Science student at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), passionate about front-end development. I have skills in JavaScript, Python, C++, HTML, and CSS, enabling me to create intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces. With a strong appreciation for design principles, I aim to blend aesthetics with functionality. Outside of my studies, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and learning about different cultures and languages. I'm eager to connect with professionals, collaborate on innovative projects, and contribute to the tech community. </p>
